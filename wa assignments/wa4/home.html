    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <article>
        <p>I am a sophomore at CU Boulder studying Creative Technology and Design with a minor in Business. I’m particularly interested in merging design, engineering, and the outdoors. I’ve worked across UX/UI design, photography, and digital design using tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, Figma, and Onshape. In addition to my educational interests, I am on the Colorado Triathlon Team, Waterskiing Team, and a member of the Alpine Club.</p>
